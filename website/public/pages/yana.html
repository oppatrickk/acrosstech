                <h5 style="text-align: left; text-align: justify; ">
                    You agree that YANA, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if
                    YANA believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may
                    be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. YANA may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access
                    to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that YANA may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your
                    account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that YANA will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.<br></h5>

                    These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and YANA and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and YANA with respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions
                    that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.<br></h5>

                <h5 style="text-align: left; text-align: justify; ">
                    These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Philippines without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and YANA agree to submit to the personal
                    and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of YANA to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
                    such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions
                    as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related
                    to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will
                    be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
                    form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of YANA, but YANA may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service
                    are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying
